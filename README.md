## The main results

See [bin/results.ipynb](./bin/results.ipynb).

## Set up the environment

### Software

Preliminaries:
- You may need to change the CUDA-related commands and settings below depending on your setup
- Make sure that `/usr/local/cuda-11.1/bin` is always in your `PATH` environment variable
- Install [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

```bash
export PROJECT_DIR=<ABSOLUTE path to the repository root>
# example: export PROJECT_DIR=/home/myusername/repositories/num-embeddings
git clone https://github.com/Yura52/tabular-dl-num-embeddings $PROJECT_DIR
cd $PROJECT_DIR

conda create -n num-embeddings python=3.9.7
conda activate num-embeddings

pip install torch==1.10.1+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt

# if the following commands do not succeed, update conda
conda env config vars set PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${PROJECT_DIR}
conda env config vars set PROJECT_DIR=${PROJECT_DIR}
# the following command appends ":/usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH;
# if your LD_LIBRARY_PATH already contains a path to some other CUDA, then the content
# after "=" should be "<your LD_LIBRARY_PATH without your cuda path>:/usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64"
conda env config vars set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/usr/local/cuda-11.1/lib64
conda env config vars set CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda-11.1
conda env config vars set CUDA_ROOT=/usr/local/cuda-11.1

# (optional) get a shortcut for toggling the dark mode with cmd+y
conda install nodejs
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-theme-toggle

conda deactivate
conda activate num-embeddings
```

### Data

LICENSE: by downloading our dataset you accept the licenses of all its components. We do not impose any new restrictions in addition to those licenses. You can find the list of sources in the paper.

```bash
cd $PROJECT_DIR
wget "https://www.dropbox.com/s/r0ef3ij3wl049gl/data.tar?dl=1" -O num_embeddings_data.tar
tar -xvf num_embeddings_data.tar
```

## How to reproduce results

The code below reproduces the results for MLP on the California Housing dataset. The pipeline for other algorithms and datasets is absolutely the same.

```
# You must explicitly set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES if you want to use GPU
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0"

# Create a copy of the 'official' config
cp exp/mlp/california/0_tuning.toml exp/mlp/california/1_tuning.toml

# Run tuning (on GPU, it takes ~30-60min)
python bin/tune.py exp/mlp/california/1_tuning.toml

# Evaluate single models with 15 different random seeds
python bin/evaluate.py exp/mlp/california/1_tuning 15

# Evaluate ensembles (by default, three ensembles of size five each)
python bin/ensemble.py exp/mlp/california/1_evaluation

# Then use bin/results.ipynb to view the obtained results
```

## Understanding the repository

### Code overview
The code is organized as follows:
- `bin`
    - `train4.py` for neural networks (it implements all the embeddings and backbones from the paper)
    - `xgboost_.py` for XGBoost
    - `catboost_.py` for CatBoost
    - `tune.py` for tuning
    - `evaluate.py` for evaluation
    - `ensemble.py` for ensembling
    - `results.ipynb` for summarizing results
    - `datasets.py` was used to build the [dataset splits](#data)
    - `synthetic.py` for generating the synthetic GBDT-friendly datasets
    - `train1_synthetic.py` for the experiments with synthetic data
- `lib` contains common tools used by programs in `bin`
- `exp` contains experiment configs and results (metrics, tuned configurations, etc.). The names of the nested folders follow the names from the paper (example: `exp/mlp-plr` corresponds to the MLP-PLR model from the paper).

### Technical notes
- You must explicitly set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` when running scripts
- for saving and loading configs, use `lib.dump_config` and `lib.load_config` instead of bare TOML libraries

### Running scripts
The common pattern for running scripts is:
```bash
python bin/my_script.py a/b/c.toml
```
where `a/b/c.toml` is the input configuration file (config). The output will be located at `a/b/c`. The config structure usually follows the `Config` class from `bin/my_script.py`.

There are also scripts that take command line arguments instead of configs (e.g. `bin/{evaluate.py,ensemble.py}`).

### train0.py vs train1.py vs train3.py vs train4.py
You need all of them for reproducing results, but you need only `train4.py` for future work, because:
- `bin/train1.py` implements a superset of features from `bin/train0.py`
- `bin/train3.py` implements a superset of features from `bin/train1.py`
- `bin/train4.py` implements a superset of features from `bin/train3.py`

To see which one of the four scripts was used to run a given experiment, check the "program" field of the corresponding tuning config. For example, here is the tuning config for MLP on the California Housing dataset: [`exp/mlp/california/0_tuning.toml`](./exp/mlp/california/0_tuning.toml). The config indicates that `bin/train0.py` was used. It means that the configs in [`exp/mlp/california/0_evaluation`](./exp/mlp/california/0_evaluation) are compatible specifically with `bin/train0.py`. To verify that, you can copy one of them to a separate location and pass to `bin/train0.py`:
```
mkdir exp/tmp
cp exp/mlp/california/0_evaluation/0.toml exp/tmp/0.toml
python bin/train0.py exp/tmp/0.toml
ls exp/tmp/0
```
